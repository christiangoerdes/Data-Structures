# Data Structures 

## General Information
This project has been developed as a team effort within the scope of the Object-Oriented Software Development module. 
It is aligned with the concepts covered in the Algorithms and Data Structures module.

In the context of this project, interfaces have been created for seven data types:

- Singly Linked List
- Doubly Linked List
- Queue
- Stack
- Priority Queue
- Ordered Set
- Hashed Set

All of these data types will be implemented, except for the ordered set. The project aims to meet the runtime requirements discussed in the "Algorithms and Data Structures" module and emphasizes effective organization of distributed collaboration along with comprehensive, well-documented solutions.
